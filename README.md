# The Telegram Bot

> In this project, I built a telegram bot as my personal assistant with only two purposes as of the November-2020. Karen, 'the telegram bot' is programmed to give hourly reminders, to <b>take a glass of water</b> and <b>take short breaks while doing any activity</b>.<br>
> Karen will also give you motivation quotes on demand.
> Thoughout the project, I implemented TDD techniques of design, OOP principles through the classes and modules used.
